And the Darwin Award goes to.... ${USER}!
Are you always this stupid or are you making a special effort today?!
Are you even trying?!
As an outsider, what do you think of the human race?
Bad.
Boooo!
Brains aren't everything. In your case they're nothing.
Clean, clear, and under control; three things that will never be said about your code.
Come on! You can do it!
Commands, random gibberish, who cares!
Don't you have anything better to do?!
Don't you know anything?
Dropped on your head as a baby, eh?
ERROR_INCOMPETENT_USER
Fake it till you make it!
Go outside.
Haha, n00b!
How many times do I have to flush before you go away?
I am _seriously_ considering 'rm -rf /'-ing myself...
I don't know what makes you so stupid, but it really works.
I never believed in chaos theory until I saw your variable naming convention!
If I gave you a penny for your thoughts, I'd get change.
If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person on earth.
If shit was music, you'd be an orchestra.
If what you don't know can't hurt you, you're invulnerable.
Incompetence is also a form of competence
Keep trying, someday you'll do something intelligent!
My keyboard is not a touch screen!
Nice try.
Pathetic
Perhaps computers is not for you...
Perhaps you should leave the command line alone...
Please step away from the keyboard!
Pro tip: type a valid command!
RTFM!
So, I'm just going to go ahead and run rm -rf / for you.
The worst one today!
This is not Windows
This is not a search engine.
This is why nobody likes you.
This is why you get to see your children only once a month.
Try using your brain the next time!
Two wrongs don't make a right, take your parents as an example.
Typing incorrect commands, eh?
What if I told you... it is possible to type valid commands.
What if... you type an actual command the next time!
What is this...? Amateur hour!?
Why are you doing this to me?!
Why are you so stupid?!
Wow! That was impressively wrong!
Y u no speak computer???
You are not as bad as people say, you are much, much worse.
You must have been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen.
You started at the bottom and it's been downhill ever since.
You're proof that god has a sense of humor.
Your application for reduced salary has been sent!
Your face looks like you've been using it as a doorstop.
